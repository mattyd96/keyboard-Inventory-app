## Installation and deployment

To run locally you can do one of two things. There is already a server that is hosted on heroku, so inside of the client folder just:

```md
npm install
```

then run with

```md
npm start
```

otherwise to run completely locally you will need to swap out the link in the ApolloProvider.js file line 19 in client. Then run the above commands
in the client folder and  

```md
node index.js
```

in the server folder.
